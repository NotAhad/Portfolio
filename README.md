## Overview

This portfolio project is designed as a dynamic digital resume that highlights my technical expertise and design aesthetics. It uses a modular component architecture with the following key elements:

- **React & TypeScript:** For a robust and maintainable codebase.
- **Tailwind CSS:** For rapid and responsive UI development.
- **EmailJS Integration:** To handle contact form submissions without the need for a backend.
- **React Router:** To manage smooth client-side navigation across different sections of the portfolio (Home, About, Projects, Contact).

## Features

- **Responsive Design:** Adapts flawlessly across mobile, tablet, and desktop screens.
- **Smooth User Interactions:** Includes drag-scrolling, dynamic scaling, and interactive buttons.
- **Modular Components:** Clean separation of concerns with components for navigation, home, about, contact, and project cards.
- **Backend-Free Email Communication:** Integration with EmailJS to allow users to contact me directly.
- **Modern UI Aesthetics:** Utilizes clean typography, structured layouts, and consistent styling with Tailwind CSS.

## Usage

**The site is structured into multiple pages:**

- **Home:** Displays a dynamic introduction with horizontal scrolling.
- **About:** Details my background, skills, and fun personal insights.
- **Projects:** Showcases my portfolio projects with project cards featuring descriptions, technology stacks, GitHub links, and live demos.
- **Contact:** Provides a contact form integrated with EmailJS for sending messages directly from the website.

**Responsive & Interactive Elements:**

- **The site adapts its layout and scaling based on the viewport, ensuring a seamless experience across devices.**

## Challenges & Solutions

### 1. Responsive Scaling

**Problem:**
Ensuring the portfolio looks great on all devices required dynamic scaling of elements and layouts.

**Solution:**
Implemented custom scaling logic with React Hooks (useState and useEffect) to dynamically adjust the scale based on window width. This approach guarantees a consistent appearance from mobile screens to large desktops.

### 2. Smooth Horizontal Scrolling

**Problem:**
Creating an intuitive horizontal scroll for the home page while preventing vertical scroll interference.

**Solution:**
Utilized a custom wheel event handler to capture and convert vertical scroll input into horizontal scrolling, providing a unique and engaging user experience.

### 3. Backend-Free Contact Form

**Problem:**
Enabling email communication without setting up a backend service.

**Solution:**
Integrated EmailJS into the contact form to handle form submissions. This allows for instant email notifications directly from the frontend while keeping the codebase lightweight and secure.

### 4. Modular and Maintainable Codebase

**Problem:**
Keeping the project organized with a clean separation of components and routes.

**Solution:**
Leveraged React Router for managing navigation between different sections. Each section is encapsulated into its own component, ensuring that the project is scalable and easy to maintain.
